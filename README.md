# ML-3D-Stereo-In-The-Dark


This project explores stereo 3D vision using a binocular camera setup that mimics human depth perception by capturing two slightly offset images and analyzing disparities to generate a depth map. The focus is on achieving accurate 3D reconstruction in low-light conditions, which pose challenges such as increased image noise, reduced scene detail, and poor feature matching. Despite these difficulties, the project aims to enable reliable depth estimation in environments where artificial lighting is limited or impossible, such as at night, underwater, or in dimly lit areas. Potential applications include autonomous nighttime navigation, low-light surveillance, and search and rescue missions.
